Graphology is a method of identifying, evaluating, and understanding human personality traits through the strokes and patterns revealed by handwriting. Although human intervention in handwriting analysis has been effective, it is costly and prone to error. The project is a small attempt on developing a program that can predict the personality traits with the aid of machine learning without human intervention.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used to classify the following handwriting features into a few selected personality traits.

Top margin
Pen pressure
Baseline angle
Letter size
Line spacing
Word spacing
Slant angle
